1. **Fork or push this repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Log in to Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Sign in with GitHub

3. **Create a new app**:
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository: `massimocristi1970/CRA_Report`
   - Branch: `main` (or your preferred branch)
   - Main file path: `app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

4. **Wait for deployment**:
   - Streamlit Cloud will install dependencies
   - Your app will be live in a few minutes

5. **Access your app**:
   - URL will be: `https://[your-app-name].streamlit.app`
   - Share this URL with your team

### Team Access Setup

**Option 1: Public Access** (No authentication)
- Your deployed app is public by default
- Share the URL with team members
- No login required

**Option 2: Restricted Access** (Streamlit Cloud Pro)
- Upgrade to Streamlit Cloud Pro for password protection
- Configure allowed email domains
- Set up SSO integration

### Configuration

The `.streamlit/config.toml` file is already configured for optimal performance:
- Max upload size: 500MB
- Optimized theme
- Security settings enabled

## Technical Details 🔧

### Performance Optimizations

- **Whitespace Parsing**: CRA rows are parsed from tab/space-delimited text
- **Right-Anchored Tail Parsing**: Postcodes, dates, and trailing numeric fields stay aligned when address text is wider than expected
- **Caching**: File parsing is cached with `@st.cache_data`
- **Pagination**: Only displays requested rows at a time
- **Split View Preview**: Freeze the first columns while browsing the rest
- **Cross-File Reconciliation**: Blank keys are ignored so match counts stay accurate

### Error Handling

- Validates file format on upload
- Handles malformed rows gracefully
- Displays helpful error messages
- Provides sample data format on errors

### Status Code Extraction Logic

```python
# Only treat tagged values like AMiss or VMr as having a CRA status code.
# Untagged titles like Mr/Mrs/Miss remain titles and do not become status M.
```

## Requirements 📦

- Python 3.8+
- streamlit >= 1.28.0
- pandas >= 2.0.0
- openpyxl >= 3.1.0

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Running Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

### File Upload Issues

**Problem**: "Failed to parse the file"
- **Solution**: Ensure your file is tab or space-delimited
- Check that rows have consistent structure
- Verify Column 7 contains status codes

**Problem**: File upload fails or times out
- **Solution**: Check file size (should be under 500MB)
- Try using a faster internet connection
- For local deployment, increase timeout in config.toml

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: App is slow with large files
- **Solution**: 
  - Use pagination with smaller page sizes
  - Apply filters to reduce displayed data
  - Clear browser cache
  - Restart the Streamlit app

### Filtering Issues

**Problem**: Filters not working as expected
- **Solution**:
  - Click "Reset All Filters" and try again
  - Check for extra spaces in search fields
  - Verify column names match expected format
